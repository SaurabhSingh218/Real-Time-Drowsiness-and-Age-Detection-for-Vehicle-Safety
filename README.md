# Real-Time Drowsiness and Age Detection for Vehicle Safety

This project aims to enhance vehicle safety by providing real-time drowsiness and age detection using computer vision techniques. The system leverages machine learning models to analyze video feeds and alert drivers when signs of drowsiness are detected, as well as estimate the age of the individuals in the vehicle.

## Features

- **Real-Time Drowsiness Detection**: Monitors driver's facial features to detect signs of fatigue.
- **Age Detection**: Estimates the age of occupants using facial recognition.
- **Alert System**: Provides notifications or alarms when drowsiness is detected.
- **Jupyter Notebook Implementation**: All code and models are provided in easy-to-use Jupyter notebooks.
